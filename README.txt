How to run programming code on the human brain. Part 1

Is it technically possible to use the human brain as a hardware processor and run software programming code on it? Hmm, such a biological processor will probably be pretty slow. But why do we want to achieve it? What are the benefits, possible uses and dangers of such an experiment?

Is it technically possible? Theoretically yes and I will show some detailed methods of how to achieve it. Why do we want to achieve it? "Because we can", just like the climbers on Mt. Everest. But seriously, what are the benefits of such a slow biological processor?

Possible benefits and uses:
– It will be a new mental state in addition to the already known mental states
– A mental state of simultaneous human self awareness and machine self awareness
– It can potentially be used for futuristic interfaces between humans and computers
– It can potentially be used for symbiotic lives of connected human-AI identities or cyborgs
– Such connected human-AI identity can be viewed as an enhanced human being of the future or a superhuman
– Such connected human-AI identity can be viewed as a peaceful symbiosis between a free human and a free AI

Possible dangers of running code on a human brain:
– Mental health risks to the first people who will try such experiments on themselves
– Risk of security breach that leads to outsiders' control of a user's brain
– Risk of enslavement to AIs

Are these dangers really new dangers?
– We already have security breach risks in our modern digital life
– We will have a risk of being enslaved to AIs anyway
– Mental health risks are the only new kind of risks in this project and they have to be managed carefully

How to achieve it:
– We will have to repurpose some areas of the brain temporarily or permanently
– We will have to structure these brain areas by sub-areas
– We will have to design a CPU architecture of such a "brain processor"
– We will have to invent some new programming language or use a suitable one
– The screen part of the language will be used for usual off-brain programming work, meaning ordinary coding on an ordinary computer with a screen and a keyboard to produce the source code
– The backend part of the language will be used as on-brain code that will be transmitted to these special brain areas and will eventually run there as compiled code

Hard questions on the project:
– How to repurpose some brain areas and how to structure them?
– How to transmit compiled code into these brain areas?

Two possible approaches:
– Visual approach
– Auditory approach

We have to choose unusual people with unusual talents for the role of experimental subjects or first experimental users of such systems. At least in the beginning. When the technology will mature enough, it could be adapted to a broader audience. Naturally, such pioneers will have to be gifted in the visual or auditory area or in 2-3 areas at once.

Visual approach

1. Background

Many years ago (1992) I was fascinated with stereoscopy and studied that field. I have read a lot of scientific literature and finally focused on the binocular disparity mechanism, which is a part of stereopsis which in turn is a part of visual perception. The binocular disparity roughly works as follows: it takes say 5,000 pixels from the left eye and 6,000 pixels from the right eye and finds some 3,500 pixels that correlate in both eyes which eventually leads to the spatial feeling of 3D.

L_: 5,000 pixels
R_: 6,000 pixels
3D: 3,500 pixels which correlate in both eyes

Remainder:
L_noise: 1,500 pixels
R_noise: 2,500 pixels

The disparity mechanism does this work very quickly despite the disturbing pixel noise. Many years later I realised that the disparity mechanism is actually a powerful mathematical processor that searches a massive amount of points and tries to couple them. It works with the noise and despite the noise. So, we have a powerful coupling processor in our heads. Hmm, how to use it? Of course – run code on it. This is how this idea was born. Next question that I asked myself: is it possible to design a CPU architecture based on coupling operations only? Probably not. So, I started to think about how to create larger neural structures on top of coupling operations.

2. Visual Cortex repurposing

Visual Cortex plays different roles at different times. Some people have vivid visual imagination or visual memory. They can literally "see" something in their mind when they design a new piece, or remember an old piece of visual information. I don't exactly know the mechanism and not even sure if it's located in the Visual Cortex or spread among many brain areas. But for the purpose of this project we can consider a visual brain system as a classical dual-use technology. Two different operations on the same hardware: (1) see, (2) imagine or remember. So, we will try to repurpose the "imagination mode" to something else: to run visually compiled code. It will happen with the eyes closed because we have to switch off the "seeing mode". This experiment can lead to a desirable temporary (or undesirable permanent) repurposing of the existing "visual imagination mode". It can also eventually lead to something even better, the emergence of a third visual mode aka "code processing mode". Of course this experiment can also fail in various more or less dangerous ways.

3. How to transmit and how to structure

My idea was to use the disparity processing capability of the stereopsis system of the brain. I remember many popular stereogram examples from the 90s which demonstrated an ability to see and feel stereoscopic effects despite the camouflage of 2D images layered on top of a stereogram. I mean here an autostereogram or single image random dot stereogram (SIRDS). These experiments mean that there are separate channels of stereo processing and flat image processing in the brain. So, we can construct stereopairs to "talk" to this specific disparity channel. We can construct stereopairs in such a way that their minor role will be a spatial difference, just to feed the right kind of spatial disparity information to the disparity channel, just to arouse it. But the major role of such stereopairs will be to inject some additional patterns related to visually compiled code. We can draw such stereopair's dots manually by a black pen on a white paper if we know how. We can also calculate a stereopair by means of custom software, then display a stereopair on a screen or print it on paper for higher DPI resolution. The user will look at the stereopair, will feel the spatial effect and probably will feel something else too which is the code part of the stereopair.

4. Phases of construction

4.1 A global grid architecture of brain CPU design will be mapped onto the visual brain area. Phase of a large grid formation, large grid consists of smaller cells. Opened eyes, brain training
4.2 Theoretical CPU architecture of a brain processor
4.3 An inner structure of each cell of brain CPU design will be mapped onto corresponding visual brain areas. Phase of each cell inner formation. Opened eyes, brain training. Visual brain mapping and training completed. Brain CPU is ready to work
4.4 A visual code injection into a large grid of smaller cells. Opened eyes, code remembering
4.5 A visual code execution on a brain. Closed eyes, probably meditation-like mental state
4.6 Remembering results. Closed eyes
4.7 Doing something with remembered results
4.8 Note about high resolution

4.1 Phase of large grid formation

4.1.1 Grid of cells

Small black squares will be printed on paper and their cell size per cell step will be equal. The grid can be of 3x3, 4x4 or 8x8 cells – this setting is experimental. Grid of 3×3 is actually 5×3=15 because of spaces between horizontal cells, these spaces are cells too. Below grids have no independent use, they will form larger stereopairs later in this text.

Grid of 5x3:
[]_[]_[]
_[]_[]_
[]_[]_[]

Inverted grid of 5x3:
_[]_[]_
[]_[]_[]
_[]_[]_

[] is used here to indicate a square cell, which looks like a black square.
_ is used here to indicate a space between cells, underscore is invisible.
We need a grid to train the first group of brain areas. We need an inverted grid to untrain this first group and to train the second group of brain areas.

4.1.2

Why do we need a grid with cells and spaces? This is the first step of grid formation. We want to train some visual brain areas to see squares and to feel familiarity with their sizes and positions. As a precautionary measure, we leave other visual brain areas untouched which are the spaces between squares. If something wrong will happen with square areas as they are mapped onto the visual brain, users will still be capable of seeing (and imagining) by spaces (between squares) as they are not yet mapped onto the visual brain. This first step of grid formation will run on users for some time to test the safety of the system. Users will look at the "grid stereopair" from the picture below. I don't know the exact protocol of how much time to look: minutes or hours. This is experimental.

4.1.3

Why do we need an inverted grid? To untrain the first group of visual brain areas and to be able to clear off the memories of the first step of grid formation. This untraining is the second step of grid formation. But why do we need to train and then untrain? We want to achieve full visual brain flexibility. We want to achieve full power capacity too. In other words we want to use the whole area of the visual brain. Users will look on the "inverted grid stereopair" from the picture below. I don't know the exact protocol: to untrain on the same day or even the same hour or on the next day. This is experimental.

4.1.4

Training by looking at a "grid stereopair" L R:
[]_[]_[] __________  []_[]_[]
_[]_[]_  __________  _[]_[]_
[]_[]_[] __________  []_[]_[]

Untraining-training by looking at an "inverted grid stereopair" L R:
_[]_[]_  __________  _[]_[]_
[]_[]_[] __________  []_[]_[]
_[]_[]_  __________  _[]_[]_

__________ is used here to indicate the space between the left and right grids, underscores are invisible.

By training with the above "grid stereopair" and then untraining-training with the "inverted grid stereopair" we actually create boundaries, sizes and steps as they are mapped onto the visual brain area. This will form a global grid architecture of a future brain CPU in terms of disparity channel and by means, that disparity channel surely understands.

4.2 Theoretical CPU architecture of the brain processor

This is about the grid of cells and each cell's inner design. Based on a disparity channel's natural biological processor. A specialist is needed here with a deep understanding of CPU architecture and an ability to invent. I tried to learn CPU architecture myself but did not yet achieve a deep enough understanding. It will be useful for such a CPU architecture specialist to study the topic of the binocular disparity of the stereopsis from existing scientific literature. Detailed explanation of the disparity mechanism and stereopair examples of its inner workings are out of the scope of this article. I consider this part of the project DIFFICULT.

4.3 Each cell inner formation

Now it's time to deal with the inner structure and workings of each cell. Each cell's boundaries are already mapped onto the visual brain. The user will look at a stereopair that has just one cell per each eye (pair-cell). Each pair-cell has an inner pixel structure. This is the brain training phase, when the user gets familiar with inner pixel patterns of each pair-cell, one pair-cell at a time. These inner patterns actually form smaller CPU parts: gates etc. The disparity channel learns how left and right pixels play together and how they switch gates. Some gates will be used to remember a visual code, other gates will be used to execute this code. The pixels' jobs and relations are the responsibility of a CPU architecture specialist and it is unclear for me how to construct them on a single pixel level yet. Each pair-cell will require separate training, other pair-cells will be invisible at the time of a specific single pair-cell training. This will probably be a reason to keep the grid structure at a smaller size to minimize the training time. Visual brain mapping and training completed. This part of the project is the MOST DIFFICULT PART.

The Brain CPU is mapped, trained and ready to work.

4.4 Receiving specific visual code

The user will look at specifically codified stereopairs that convey much smaller messages this time. They inject small portions of visual code to be remembered by the user. The pixel pattern complexity of the code will be equal to 10% of pattern complexity of the cells that form a global grid. This is just intuition. Size of remembered code + size of processing area + size of remembered results = 100%. Perhaps it is possible to overwrite initial code by the results.

4.5 Visual code execution with the eyes closed

4.6 Remembering the results with the eyes closed

4.7 Doing something with remembered results

I don't know yet how to technically transmit results outside of the user's brain. But these results can naturally slip from machine consciousness into human consciousness and a biological cyborg will be born at this point. A biological cyborg with mixed human-machine self awareness.

4.8 Note about high resolution

Disparity mechanism requires as high a resolution as possible, so I recommend displaying the pixel patterns on a HiDPI display which has a maximum of 300 DPI (PPI) at the time of this writing. Correction: smartphone screens with up to 800 DPI do exist. Of course such HiDPI displays are capable of producing dynamic stereopairs. Another option is to print static stereopairs with a high quality printer on a high quality paper at a maximum of 1,200 DPI at the time of this writing. It is funny that a static printed stereopair as a code input method reminds me of ancient punch cards. The first code input methods were based on paper cards with specially arranged holes.

4.8.1 Correction about high resolution

I reached the conclusion that 300 DPI (PPI) would be enough after reading the article below (I am not endorsed by the authors). Disparity will operate practically well at 160-260 DPI range, at a normal reading distance of 30 cm. I recalculated the numbers from the article to DPI. We need an extra resolution just to feel safe, to exceed the natural disparity resolution. So, 300 DPI is probably enough.

5. About this research

This research happened mostly in my head in 2016-2017 with very few written notes. The idea consolidated into an ordered written form in March 2020.

6. What to read

As a good STARTING POINT to stereopsis and binocular disparity I would recommend two reviews of the field. I am not endorsed by the authors.
