How to run programming code on the human brain. Part 1.

Is it technically possible to use a human brain as a hardware processor to run a software programming code on it? Hmm, such a biological processor will be probably pretty slow. But why do we want to achieve it? Which are the benefits, possible uses and dangers of such an experiment?

Is it technically possible? Probably yes and I will show some detailed methods of how to achieve it.

Why do we want to achieve it? “Because we can”, just like climbers on Everest. But seriously, what are the benefits of such a slow biological processor?

Possible benefits and uses:
- it will be a new mental state in addition to already known mental states
- mental state of simultaneous human self awareness and machine self awareness
- can be potentially used for futuristic interfaces between humans and computers
- can be potentially used for symbiotic lives of connected human-AI identities or cyborgs
- such connected human-AI identity can be viewed as enhanced future human being or superhuman
- such connected human-AI identity can be viewed as peaceful symbiosis between free human and free AI

Possible dangers of running code on a brain:
- mental health risks to first people who will try such experiments on themselves
- risk of security breach that leads to outsiders control of user’s brain
- risk of slavery to AIs

Are these dangers really new dangers?
- we already have security breach risks in our modern digital life
- we will have a risk of slavery to AIs anyway
- mental health risks are the only new kind of risks in this project and they have to be managed carefully

How to achieve it:
- we have to repurpose some brain areas temporary or permanently
- we have to structure these brain areas by sub-areas
- we have to design a CPU architecture of such brain processor
- we have to invent some new programming language or use a suitable one
- screen part of a language will be used for usual off-brain programming work, I mean usual coding on usual computer/screen/keyboard to produce a source code
- backend part of a language will be used as on-brain code that will be transmitted to these special brain areas and will eventually run there as a compiled code

Hard questions of the project:
- how to repurpose some brain areas and how to structure them?
- how to transmit compiled code into these brain areas?

Two possible approaches:
- visual approach
- hearing approach

We have to choose unusual people with unusual talents for a role of experimental subjects or first experimental users of such systems. At least at the beginning. When the technology will mature enough, it could be adapted to a broad audience. Naturally, such first people have to be gifted in the visual or hearing area or in 2-3 areas at once.

Visual approach

1. Background

Many years ago I was fascinated with stereoscopy and studied this field. I have read a lot of scientific literature and finally focused on Disparity Apparatus, which is a part of human visual perception. Disparity Apparatus works as follows: it takes say 5,000 pixels from a left eye and 6,000 pixels from a right eye and finds some 3,500 pixels that correlate in both eyes and this eventually leads to spatial feeling of 3d.

L_: 5,000 pixels
R_: 6,000 pixels
3d: 3,500 pixels correlate in both eyes

Remainder:
L_noise: 1,500 pixels
R_noise: 2,500 pixels

Disparity Apparatus does this work very quickly despite disturbing pixel noise. Many years later I realised that Disparity Apparatus is actually a powerful mathematical processor, that searches a massive amount of points and tries to couple them. With noise and despite the noise. So, we have a powerful coupling processor in our heads. Hmm, how to use it? Of course, run a code on it. This is how this idea was born. Next question that I asked myself: is it possible to design CPU architecture based on coupling operations only? Probably not. So, I started to think about how to create larger neural structures on top of coupling operations.

2. Visual Cortex repurposing

Visual Cortex plays different roles at different times. Some people have vivid visual imagination or visual memory. They can literally “see” something in their mind when they design a new piece or remember an old piece of visual information. I don’t exactly know a mechanism and I don’t even sure it is located in the Visual Cortex and not spread among many brain areas. But for the purpose of this project we can consider a visual brain system as a classical dual-use technology. Two different operations on the same hardware: (1) see, (2) imagine or remember. So, we will try to re-purpose the “imagination mode” to something else: to run visually compiled code. It will happen with closed eyes because we have to switch off the “seeing mode”. This experiment can lead to desirable temporary (or undesirable permanent) re-purpose of existing “visual imagination mode”. This experiment can eventually lead to the emergence of third visual mode aka “code processing mode” and it is even more desirable. Of course this experiment can fail in various less or more dangerous ways.

3. How to transmit and how to structure

My idea was to use Disparity Apparatus of the stereoscopy visual perception of a brain. I remember many stereogram examples from the 90s which demonstrated an ability to see and feel stereoscopic effects despite the camouflage of 2d image layered on top of stereogram. These experiments mean that there are separate channels of stereo processing and flat image processing in a brain. So, we can construct stereopairs to “talk” to this specific channel named Disparity Apparatus. We can construct stereopairs in such a way that their minor role will be a spatial difference, just to feed the right kind of the spatial disparity information to Disparity Apparatus, just to arouse it. But the major role of such stereopairs will be to inject some additional patterns related to visually compiled code. We can draw such stereopair’s dots even manually by a black pen on a white paper if we know how. Or we can construct a stereopair in a 3d CAD software. Or we can calculate a stereopair by means of custom software, then display a stereopair on a screen or print it on a paper for higher dpi resolution. User will look on a stereopair and will feel the spatial effect and probably will feel something else too which is the code part of stereopair.

4. Phases of construction

4.1 - A global grid architecture of brain CPU design will be mapped onto visual brain area. Phase of large grid formation, large grid consists of smaller cells. Opened eyes, brain training
4.2 - Theoretical CPU architecture of brain processor
4.3 - An inner structure of each cell of brain CPU design will be mapped onto corresponding visual brain areas. Phase of each cell inner formation. Opened eyes, brain training
4.4 - A visual code injection into a large grid of smaller cells. Opened eyes, code remembering
4.5 - A visual code execution on a brain. Closed eyes, probably meditation-like mental state
4.6 - Remembering results. Closed eyes
4.7 - Doing something with remembered results
4.8 - Note about high resolution

4.1 Phase of large grid formation

4.1.1 Grid of cells

Small black squares will be printed on paper and their cell size per cell step will be equal. Grid can be 3x3 or 4x4 or 8x8 and this setting is experimental. Below grids have no independent use, they will form larger stereopairs later in this text.

Grid:
[]_[]_[]
_[]_[]_
[]_[]_[]

Reversed grid:
_[]_[]_
[]_[]_[]
_[]_[]_

[] used here to indicate a square cell, it looks like black square on paper.
_ used here to indicate a space between cells, underscore is invisible on paper.
We need a grid to train a first group of brain areas. We need a reversed grid to untrain this first group and to train a second group of brain areas.

4.1.2

Why do we need a grid with cells and spaces? This is the first step of grid formation. We want to train some visual brain areas to see squares and to feel familiarity with their sizes and positions. As a precaution measure, we leave untouched other visual brain areas which are spaces between squares. If something wrong will happen with squares areas as they are mapped onto a visual brain, users will still be capable of seeing (and imagining) by spaces (between squares) as they are mapped onto a visual brain. This first step of grid formation will run on users for some time period to check safety. Users will look on the "grid stereopair" from the picture below. I don't know an exact protocol of how much time to look: minutes, hours. Experimental.

4.1.3

Why do we need a reversed grid? To untrain the first group of visual brain areas, to be able to clear off memories of the first step of grid formation. Untraining is a second step. But why do we need to train and then untrain? We want to achieve full visual brain flexibility. We want to achieve full power capacity too, in other words we want to use the whole area of the visual brain. Users will look on the "reversed grid stereopair" from the picture below. I don't know an exact protocol: to untrain in the same day or even in the same hour or to untrain in the next day. Experimental.

4.1.4

Training by looking on "grid stereopair" L R:
[]_[]_[] __________  []_[]_[]
_[]_[]_  __________  _[]_[]_
[]_[]_[] __________  []_[]_[]

Untraining-training by looking on "reversed grid stereopair" L R:
_[]_[]_  __________  _[]_[]_
[]_[]_[] __________  []_[]_[]
_[]_[]_  __________  _[]_[]_

__________ used here to indicate a space between left and right grids, underscores are invisible on paper.

By training with above "grid stereopair" and then untraining-training with "reversed grid stereopair" we actually create a familiarity of metrics, we create boundaries, sizes and steps as they are mapped onto the visual brain area. This will form a grid architecture of future brain CPU in terms of Disparity Apparatus and by means, that Disparity Apparatus surely understands.

4.2 Theoretical CPU architecture of brain processor

This is about the grid of cells and each cell inner design. Based on Disparity Apparatus biological processor. A specialist needed here with a deep understanding of CPU architecture and ability to invent. I tried to learn CPU architecture myself but didn’t achieve a deep understanding yet. It will be useful for such CPU architecture specialist to study a topic of Disparity Apparatus of human visual perception from existing scientific literature. Detailed explanation of Disparity Apparatus and stereopair examples of its inner workings are out of the scope of this article. I consider this part of the project as a DIFFICULT PART.

4.3 Each cell inner formation

Now it is a time to deal with the inner structure and workings of each cell. Each cell's boundaries are already mapped onto a visual brain. User will look at a stereopair that has just one cell per each eye (pair-cell). Each pair-cell has an inner pixel structure. This is a brain training phase, when the user gets familiar with inner pixel patterns of each pair-cell, one pair-cell at a time. These inner patterns actually form smaller CPU parts: gates etc. Disparity Apparatus learns how left and right pixels play together and how they switch gates. Some gates will be used to remember a visual code, other gates will be used to execute this code. Pixels jobs and relations are a responsibility of CPU architecture specialist and it is unclear for me how to construct them on a single pixel level yet. Each pair-cell will require a separate training, other pair-cells will be invisible at the time of a specific single pair-cell training. This will be probably a reason to keep grid structure at smaller size to minimize training time. Grid of 3x3 is actually 5x3=15 because of spaces between horizontal cells, these spaces are cells too. Visual brain mapping-training completed. This part of the project is a MOST DIFFICULT PART.

Brain CPU mapped, trained and ready to work.

4.4 Receiving specific visual code

A user will look at specifically codified stereopairs that convey much smaller messages this time. They inject small portions of visual code to be remembered by the user. Pixel pattern complexity of a code will be equal 10% of pattern complexity of cells that form a global grid. This is just intuition. Size of remembered code + size of processing area + size of remembered results = 100%. Perhaps it is possible to overwrite initial code by results.

4.5 Visual code execution with closed eyes

4.6 Remembering results with closed eyes

4.7 Doing something with remembered results

I don't know yet how to technically transmit results outside of the user's brain. But these results can naturally slip from machine consciousness into human consciousness and a biological cyborg will be born at this point. Biological cyborg with mixed human-machine self awareness.

4.8 Note about high resolution

Disparity Apparatus of human visual perception requires as high resolution as possible. So I recommend to display cells with pixel patterns on a HiDPI display which have maximum 300 dpi at the time of this writing. Of course such HiDPI display is capable of producing dynamic stereopairs. Or just print static stereopairs with a high quality printer on a high quality paper at 1,200 dpi at the time of this writing. It is funny that a static printed stereopairs as a code input method reminds me an ancient perfokarts. The first code input methods were based on a paper cards with specially arranged holes.

This version March 31, 2020: added numbered structure for better understanding of document flow, some editing. Previous version was March 12, 2020.

This research happened to me mostly in my head in 2016-2017 approximately, with some writings in my paper notebooks. I will try to look into my notebooks of that period to find additional useful information. This text will be updated from time to time. I will do English proofreading and I will be happy to receive corrections from native speakers. Some thoughtful additions, remarks and reader feedback will be added to this text.

I have more recent visual ideas of year 2020, about the visual approach of this research, but these ideas are much less consolidated and I have to mull them more in my head. Those ideas will probably go to Part 2. I have no clue of how to do it via a hearing channel, just added such possibility as I know that people who are gifted in hearing do exist.
